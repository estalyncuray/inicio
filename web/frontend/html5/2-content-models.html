    In HTML, elements typically belonged in either the block level or inline content model. HTML5 introduces seven main content models.
    - Metadata
    - Embedded
    - Interactive
    - Heading
    - Phrasing
    - Flow
    - Sectioning

    Metadata: Content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of the content. These elements are found in the head of the document.
    Elements: <base>, <link>, <meta>, <noscript>, <script>, <style>, <title>

    Embedded: Content that imports other resources into the document.
    Elements: <audio>, <video>, <canvas>, <iframe>, <img>, <math>, <object>, <svg>

    Interactive: Content specifically intended for user interaction.
    Elements: <a>, <audio>, <video>, <button>, <details>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <label>, <object>, <select>, <textarea>

    Heading: Defines a section header.
    Elements: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <hgroup>

    Phrasing: This model has a number of inline level elements in common with HTML4.
    Elements: <img>, <span>, <strong>, <label>, <br />, <small>, <sub>, and more.+

    Flow content: Contains the majority of HTML5 elements that would be included in the normal flow of the document.
