<!--
    When writing HTML5 documents, one of the first new features that you'll notice is the doc type declaration:
    the character encoding (charset) declaration is also simplified:
    - New Elements in HTML5
        <article>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, 
        <footer>, <header>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <section>, <video>, and even more!

    - Forms
        - The Web Forms 2.0 specification allows for creation of more powerful forms and more compelling user experiences.
        - Date pickers, color pickers, and numeric stepper controls have been added.
        - Input field types now include email, search, and URL.
        - PUT and DELETE form methods are now supported.

        - Drag and Drop
        - Audio and Video
        - Offline Web Applications
        - History
        - Local Storage
        - Geolocation
        - Web Messaging
