    <!--
        In HTML, most elements are defined as block level or inline elements.
        Block level elements start from a new line.
        For example: <h1>, <form>, <li>, <ol>, <ul>, <p>, <pre>, <table>, <div>, etc.

        Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks.
        For example: <b>, <a>, <strong>, <img>, <input>, <em>, <span>, etc.

        The <div> element is a block-level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
        When used together with some CSS styling, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
    -->
    <span>Inline element</span>
    <hr>
    <div>
        Block
    </div>
</body>
