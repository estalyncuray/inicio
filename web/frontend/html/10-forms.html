<!--
    HTML forms are used to collect information from the user.
    Forms are defined using the <form> element, with its opening and closing

    Use the 'action' attribute to point to a webpage that will load after the user submits the form.

    The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when forms are submitted (see below for description):

    - When you use GET, the form data will be visible in the page address
    - Use POST if the form is updating data, or includes sensitive information (passwords).
        POST offers better security because the submitted data is not visible in the page address.
    
    - To take in user input, you need the corresponding form elements, such as text fields. 
        The <input> element has many variations, depending on the type attribute. It can be a text, password, radio, URL, submit, etc.

    - The type "radio" allows user to select only one of a number of choices:
    
    - The type "checkbox" allows the user to select more than one option:

    - The submit button submits a form to its action attribute:
