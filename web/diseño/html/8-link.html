<!--
Links are also an integral part of every web page. You can add links to text or images 
that will enable the user to click on them in order to be directed to another file or webpage.
In HTML, links are defined using the <a> tag.

Use the href attribute to define the link's destination address:
-->

     <!--  URL
        The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
        Giving a _blank value to your attribute will have the link open in a new window or new tab:
    -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>8</title>
</head>
<body>   
    <a href="#">Link to URL</a>
    <hr>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Open a new web page with Link the URL</a>
</body>
<footer>
    <hr>
    <span>estalyncuray</span>
